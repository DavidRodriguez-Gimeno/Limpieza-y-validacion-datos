# Limpieza-y-validacion-datos
This repository has been created to show the resolution of the assignment: data cleaning and validation, as part of the subject Data Typology and Lifecycle included in the UOC University Data Science Master.

We work with a dataset of used cars obtained through web scraping of the following websites, www.cars.com and www.carsoup.com. What is intended is to predict the price of a used car through the most representative variables such as mileage, year, make and model.

During the process the data is checked, the empty values are filled and once the database is ready, the simple and multiple linear regression models are applied.
